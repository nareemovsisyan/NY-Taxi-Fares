# NY-Taxi-Fares
# **Analyzing New York Taxi Data**

## **Introduction**

In this project, you get to work with the data from a large number of taxi journeys in New York from 2013. You will use regression trees and random forests to predict the value of fares and tips, based on location, date and time.

## **Dataset**

We'll use 2013 NY Taxi dataset, publicly available, containing detailed information about taxi rides and their fares in New York during 2013.

## **Getting the Data**

Obtain the data from [here](https://chriswhong.com/open-data/foil_nyc_taxi/). Don’t take the whole dataset (it’s too big), ~50k rides should be ok.

## **Deliverables**

1. Data Preprocessing: Clean, preprocess, and handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Convert data types and handle categorical variables.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify trends, patterns, and correlations through visualizations and statistical analysis.
3. Feature Engineering: Derive new features to enhance predictive power.
4. Model Building: Explore algorithms like linear regression, decision trees, or random forests. Train, tune hyperparameters, and select the most suitable model.
5. Model Evaluation: Evaluate models using metrics like MSE, MAPE, etc. Compare and choose the best-performing model.
6. Fare Predictions: Make predictions using unseen data and assess performance.
